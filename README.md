# doebox

Welcome to the development branch of doebox, the DE element of AvdanDOE.

Named main to avoid conflicts and people submitting pull requests to the production branches, here you will find the most up-to-date, unstable and everchanging version of doebox as of right now.

Feel free to install and run it with latest tools like eww and plank, but keep in mind that everything here is prone to break, change, be added or removed, and whatnot, so we advice staying in the release branches if you want to test doebox out.
