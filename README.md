# doebox
The desktop environment element for AvdanDOE.

## components
Doebox is built upon various things, like customized versions of Cutefish DE (not contained in this repository), elkowar's wacky widgets, plank and others.

## separate installation
`(not encouraged to use it outside of the AvdanDOE yet, in case of any issues outside of AvdanDOE, do NOT open an issue, or mention you're using it outside of AvdanDOE)`

Make sure you have eww (elkowar's wacky widgets), material design icons font, harmonyos sans font and plank (bare minimum) on your system.
Go into the `eww.yuck` file in `dock` and change the effective configuration path.
Place respective configuratons into their folders (for info refer to the packages' manuals) and launch plank with `plank`, open its settings and configure it to use the proper theme and positions. Launch eww with `eww -c 'config path' open-many dockstatus dockmain dockstatic dockdynamic`
