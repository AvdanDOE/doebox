# doebox

The desktop environment element for AvdanDOE.

## Components

Doebox is built upon various things, like customized versions of Cutefish DE (not included in this repository, but should be ran on top of), elkowar's wacky widgets, plank and others.

## Separate installation

You are beforehand heavily discouraged from running the doebox outside of AvdanDOE, but you can do so nevertheless, following the instructions.

1. Make sure you have eww (elkowar's wacky widgets), material design icons font, harmonyos sans font and plank (bare minimum) on your system. It is encouraged you use a binary version of eww, that is added to path, otherwise you might have to spend some time configuring it to run its own commands outside of the code.
2. Place respective configuratons into their folders (for info refer to the packages' manuals).
3. Launch eww with `eww -c 'config path' open-many dockstatus dockmain dockstatic dockdynamic`

## FDT ISO Testing

You can try out the latest, freshest doebox, including some of its other components, by livebooting the FDT (Feature Drop Test) ISO of AvdanDOE, which you can find on the project's [Discord](https://dsc.gg/avdandoe).
